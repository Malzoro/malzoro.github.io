I go online by the name **uint8_t\***, but you can call me daddy.

I'm a 22-year-old Canadian security researcher, proficient in both English and French, I am a student with an insatiable appetite for all things low-level, currently with a focus on :
- ⚙️ **Software Exploitation and Development**: I take pleasure in exposing the vulnerabilities concealed within software, bending them to my will. (vulnerability research)

- ☠️ **Malware Analysis**: I have descended headfirst into the ominous realm of malware, dissecting its malevolent code to unearth its sinister intentions.

- ⚔️ **Red-Teaming Tactics**: I have honed my skills in the shadowy art of penetration testing, mastering the techniques of cyber infiltrators to guard against their malevolent schemes.
